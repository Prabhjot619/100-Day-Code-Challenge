The journey continues with Q21–Q30, focusing on advanced use of arrays, structures, and modular programming.
This phase builds stronger logic and code organization through practical, real-world examples.

Goal:
To write cleaner, modular code and understand how data structures improve program efficiency.

Each question includes:

Problem statement

Code solution

Example output

Motivation:

“Code is like a muscle — the more you train it, the stronger it gets.”
