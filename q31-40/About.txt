In Q31–Q40, I dive into file handling, string manipulation, and algorithm-based logic.
This stage bridges the gap between basic programming and real applications.

Goal:
To gain practical understanding of data storage, string operations, and algorithmic problem-solving.

Each question includes:

Problem statement

Code solution

Example output

Motivation:

“Don’t just write code — write something that teaches you.”
