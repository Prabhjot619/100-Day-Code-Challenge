100 Days of Code – Q1 to Q10 (C Language)

I’ve started my 100 Days of Code challenge, solving 2 C programming questions daily.
These first 10 questions cover the basics — input/output, conditions, loops, functions, arrays, and simple logic building.

Goal:
Build consistency, improve logic, and strengthen C programming fundamentals.

Each question includes:

Problem statement

Code solution

Example output

Motivation:

“Every line of code is a step closer to mastery.”
