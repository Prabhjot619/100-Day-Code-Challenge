Continuing my 100 Days of Code challenge, I’m solving 2 C programming questions daily.

These questions (Q11–Q20) explore intermediate C concepts — nested loops, string handling, pointers, functions with parameters, and basic problem-solving with arrays.

Goal:
To move beyond the basics, strengthen logic, and gain confidence in applying C concepts to real problems.

Each question includes:

Problem statement

Code solution

Example output

Motivation:

“Progress happens one problem at a time — keep coding, keep growing.”
